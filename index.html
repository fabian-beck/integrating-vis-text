        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <marginal>Similar but different</marginal>
        <p><b>A <em>data visualization</em> is a visual representation of information encoded in <em>geometric primitives</em> that we perceive, process, and interpret to consume the information.</b></p>

        <p><b>A <em>text</em> is a visual representation of information encoded in <em>characters</em> that we perceive, process, and interpret to consume the information.</b></p>

        <marginal>Integrated visualization and text can make a difference</marginal>
        <p>The way of encoding might be different but a visualization and a text are hence similar in the sense that they both convey information to a human reader. Often, they are combined and complement each other as part of documents, user interfaces, presentation slides and the like. While this complementing similarity is certainly not a new observation, it still remains surprising to me how little the combination and close integration of the two modalities haven been investigated. I believe we can do much more than just placing the visualization next to the text, like in a traditional research paper or printed news article. With this book, I want to explore possibilities for a better integration:</p>

        <marginal>This is also the outline of the book.</marginal>
        <ul>
            <li>How <em>graphics at the size of word</em> can be embedded in line with the text.</em></li>
            <li>How <em>interactive documents</em> can connect visualizations and related text fragments.</li>
            <li>How <em>text that is automatically generated</em> integrates with visualization.</li>
            <li>How other types of text such as <em>source code becomes visually agumentated</em>.</li>
            <li>How <em>interactive systems</em> might leverage integrated designs of text and viualization.</li>
        </ul>

        <marginal>Is the book for you?</marginal>
        <p>This book is written for everybody being interested in <em>how to effectively communicate data and information as part of documents</em> beyond what is the state of the art currently. The book is not targeted at novelists and poets, but at authors of data-related texts such as data reports, papers, and news stories, at designers and developers of user interfaces and authoring systems, and at researchers from diverse fields not limited to human-computer interaction, visualization, scientific communication, data-driven journalism, and media science. I am a computer scientist and visualization researcher, hence, the book has a certain technical and a specific research perspective, but I am trying to address a broader scope.</p>

        <info title="About the Author">Fabian Beck is an assistant professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen, where he leads a research group on visualization.</info>

        <marginal>Attention: <br/>it's an interactive book! Try it out and send feedback.</marginal>
        <p>I am using the book also as a testbed for designing a truly interactive publication. For instance, it countains additional explanations that you can view on demand such as this short list of available interactions that you can show by clicking on the following info icon ...</p>

        <h1>Word-sized Graphics</h1>

        <p>A first approach to integrate visualization and text is to make the visualization a word.</p>

        <h2>The Content of the Graphics</h2>

        <p>... We have described this design space of word-sized graphics in a shorter version earlier&nbsp;<cit>Latif2018Visually</cit>.</p>

        <h2>Designing the Graphics</h2>

        <h2>Placing the Graphics</h2>

        <p>... in the sentence or at the end, in the line or between the lines, typesetting problems such as line wrapping</p>

        <h2>Graphics in Tables and Lists</h2>

        <p>While word-sized graphics were suggested and already used to some extent in texts, admittedly, they had their biggest breakthrough as parts of <keyword>tables</keyword> and <keyword>lists</keyword>. Especially, their introduction to <keyword>Microsoft Excel</keyword> in ... made them widely applied.</p>

        <p>To give an example, <ref>table:table_without_sparklines</ref> shows citation statistics of some papers over time without any graphics, while <ref>table:table_with_sparklines</ref> displays the same information embedding word-sized graphics for the citation trends.</p>

        <table data-label="table:table_without_sparklines">
            <caption>Some well-cited visualization papers (citations shown as numbers).</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Title</th>
                <th>Authors</th>
                <th colspan="9">Citations (2014&ndash;2018)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>The eyes have it: A task by data type taxonomy for information visualizations</td>
                <td>Shneiderman</td>
                <td>478</td>
                <td>454</td>
                <td>451</td>
                <td>502</td>
                <td>453</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <table data-label="table:table_with_sparklines">
            <caption>Some well-cited visualization papers (citations shown as word-sized graphics).</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Title</th>
                <th>Authors</th>
                <th>Citations (2014&ndash;2018)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>A somewhat extreme example to use small graphics in tables are <em>Gestaltlines</em>&nbsp;<cit>Brandes2011Asymmetric</cit>.</p>

        <h2>Tools and Libraries</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>D3js:</b></li>
            <li><b>Fonts:</b></li>
            <li><b>jQuery Sparklines:</b></li>
            <li><b>Microsoft Excel:</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>An Example in D3js</h2>

        <h1>Vis&ndash;Text Interaction</h1>

        <p>Readers consume more and more text from screens and less and less from paper. Whereas I certainly still see advantages of paper and sometimes myself prefer reading longer text on papers, I also observe that an important feature of screens are not yet leveraged for documents: <em>interactivity</em>.</p>

        <p>There are of course exceptions: interactive documents ..., for instance, data-driven journalism</p>

        <h2>Local Interactions</h2>

        <h2>Global Interactions</h2>

        <h2>Transitions</h2>

        <h1>Generated Text and Visualization</h1>

        <p>Visualizations are generated automatically from data. Text, in contrast, gets manually written.</p>

        <p>To give an example, the following text describing some statistics on this book is generated automatically and can be adapted interactively by filling in different words in the input boxes.</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <h2>Text Generation</h2>

        <p><em>Natural Language Generation</em> is an established field providing many techniques to produce text from data. In a way, it is the little sister of <em>Natural Language Processing</em>, that is, the extraction of data from natural language text. In context of Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and other chat bots everybody talks about their abilities to understand and interpret natural language, but they actually also need to answer and generate natural language. Since our examples are documents, here, I focus only on the generation of the written text, but not how a computer can read and pronounce the words in a natural way.</p>

        <h2>Exploranation</h2>

        <h2>Ethical Implications</h2>

        <p>...</p>

        <p> However, the more control over the text is left to the author, the less critical are those implications. In a template based text, the variants that can be produced only vary in a restricted range and can be tested systematically.</p>

        <p>In essence, the ethical issues are comparable to those when involving algorithms in the decision making process. Especially, involving machine learning ...</p>

        <h1>Visually Augmenting Source Code</h1>

        <p>We have talked about natural language text so far, but there are other kinds of texts, one of the most influential ones: <em>source code</em>. Actually, my first experience with enriching textual content with data visualizations was in augmenting code. ... </p>
