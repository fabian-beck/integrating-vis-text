        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>A <em>data visualization</em> is a visual representation of information encoded in <em>geometric primitives</em> that
            we perceive, process, and interpret to consume the information.</p>

        <p>A <em>text</em> is a visual representation of information encoded in <em>characters</em> that we perceive,
            process, and interpret to consume the information.</p>

        <p>The way of encoding might be different but visualization and text are hence similar in the sense that they both convey information to a human reader. Often, they are combined and complement each other as part of documents, user interfaces, presentation slides and the like. While this complementing similarity is certainly not a new observation, it still remains surprising to me how little the combination and close integration of the two modalities haven been investigated. With this book, I want to contribute to closing this gap.</p>

        <h1>Word-sized Graphics</h1>

        <p>A first approach to integrate visualization and text is to make the visualization a word.</p>
