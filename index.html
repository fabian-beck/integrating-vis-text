        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>A <em>data visualization</em> is a visual representation of information encoded in <em>geometric primitives</em> that we perceive, process, and interpret to consume the information.</p>

        <p>A <em>text</em> is a visual representation of information encoded in <em>characters</em> that we perceive, process, and interpret to consume the information.</p>

        <p>The way of encoding might be different but visualization and text are hence similar in the sense that they both convey information to a human reader. Often, they are combined and complement each other as part of documents, user interfaces, presentation slides and the like. While this complementing similarity is certainly not a new observation, it still remains surprising to me how little the combination and close integration of the two modalities haven been investigated. With this book, I want to contribute to closing this gap.</p>

        <h1>Word-sized Graphics</h1>

        <p>A first approach to integrate visualization and text is to make the visualization a word.</p>

        <h2>Determining the Content of the Graphics</h2>

        <h2>Designing the Graphics</h2>

        <h2>Placing the Graphics</h2>

        <!--p>in the sentence or at the end, in the line or between the lines, typesetting problems such as line wrapping</p-->

        <h2>Graphics in Tables and Lists</h2>

        <p>While word-sized graphics were suggested and already used to some extent in texts, admittedly, they had their biggest breakthrough as parts of <keyword>tables</keyword> and <keyword>lists</keyword>. Especially, their introduction to <keyword>Microsoft Excel</keyword> in ... made them widely applied.</p>

        <p>To give an example, <ref>table:table_without_sparklines</ref> shows citation statistics of some papers over time without any graphics, while <ref>table:table_with_sparklines</ref> displays the same information embedding word-sized graphics for the citation trends.</p>

        <table data-label="table:table_without_sparklines">
            <caption>Some well-cited visualization papers (citations shown as numbers).</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Title</th>
                <th>Authors</th>
                <th colspan="9">Citations (2014&ndash;2018)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>The eyes have it: A task by data type taxonomy for information visualizations</td>
                <td>Shneiderman</td>
                <td>478</td>
                <td>454</td>

                <td>502</td>
                <td>453</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <table data-label="table:table_with_sparklines">
            <caption>Some well-cited visualization papers (citations shown as word-sized graphics).</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Title</th>
                <th>Authors</th>
                <th>Citations (2014&ndash;2018)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Tools and Libraries</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>D3js:</b></li>
            <li><b>jQuery Sparklines:</b></li>
            <li><b>Microsoft Excel:</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>An Example in D3js</h2>

        <h1>Vis&ndash;Text Interaction</h1>

        <p>Readers consume more and more text from screens and less and less from paper. Whereas I certainly still see advantages of paper and sometimes myself prefer reading longer text on papers, I also observe that an important feature of screens are not yet leveraged for documents: <em>interactivity</em>.</p>

        <h2>Local Interactions</h2>

        <h2>Global Interactions</h2>

        <h2>Transitions</h2>

        <h1>Generated Text and Visualization</h1>
